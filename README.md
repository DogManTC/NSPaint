Tested with the Tony graphical Neuro-api interface (https://github.com/Pasu4/neuro-api-tony)

Using the neuro sdk documentation to allow Neuro-sama to create original artworks as well as collaborate with human artists. In theory anyway.
I had plans for this. I wanted to make it something to be proud of. I hope someone may pick up where I left off and make me proud ;)
